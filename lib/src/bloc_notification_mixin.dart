/// The [BlocNotificationMixin] is a Flutter Bloc mixin that provides a simple
/// notification mechanism for handling UI-related actions separately from the
/// state. By using this mixin, you can fire notifications from the `Bloc` and
/// handle them in the UI layer using a callback mechanism,
/// without having to manage them in the state.
///
/// To use the [BlocNotificationMixin], simply import the `flutter_bloc`
/// package, and apply the mixin to your [Bloc] / [Cubit] :
///
/// ```dart
/// class MyBloc extends Bloc<MyEvent, MyState> with BlocNotificationMixin<MyState, MyNotification> {
///   // ...
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The [BlocNotificationMixin] defines a `Stream` of notifications that can be
/// listened to by the UI layer using the notification getter. To fire a
/// notification from the [Bloc] / [Cubit], simply call the notify method with
/// the notification payload:
///
/// ```dart
/// notify(MyNotification(payload));
/// ```
///
/// Where `MyNotification` is a class that represents the notification and
/// payload is the data associated with the notification.
